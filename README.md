### Company Values Thoughts

Consider this quote from [a great read](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/03/things-learn-business-school/):

> A mission statement describes the current central purpose and goal of an organization, to guide daily decision making and performance.  A vision statement describes what an organization seeks to become, or the ideal society to which the organization seeks to contribute.

> When drafting and evaluating potential mission and vision statements, ask if the opposite of a proposed statement is obviously undesirable. If it is, the statement is obviously undesirable. For example, a university mission statement that says the institution “seeks to produce highly effective productive citizens” is unlikely to have any real influence on employees or students, since no university seeks to produce its opposite—ineffective, unproductive citizens. A more meaningful statement will assert that which is truly specific to the organization; it describes what the organization seeks to do that many or most of its peers do not.


##### Invested in growth
- We **look** for opportunities to help our employees and customers grow. 
- While growth will take some people out of their role at the company we hope it will keep many others within the company and contributing in new ways. 
- If a person is interested in changing roles we test out these changes with small changes. This can be expanded responsibilities or training while on the job.
