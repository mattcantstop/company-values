### Company Values Thoughts

##### Invested in growth
- We **look** for opportunities to help our employees and customers grow. 
- While growth will take some people out of their role at the company we hope it will keep many others within the company and contributing in new ways. 
- If a person is interested in changing roles we test out these changes with small changes. This can be expanded responsibilities or training while on the job.
